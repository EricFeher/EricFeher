## About Me

I have been interested in programming since I first encountered it in secondary school. Throughout my studies, I realized that software development was not just a mere field of study for me, but a true passion.

## My Career In Software Development

I had the opportunity to start my career at a young age. As a **Programming Instructor**, I taught elementary school students the basics of programming. This experience not only improved my communication skills, but also reinforced my belief that I should and will stay in the IT sector, and it laid the foundation for my further studies in Computer Science.

During my academic journey, I honed my technical skills and gained a deep understanding of software architecture, algorithms, and development methodologies. Also, I got admitted to an internship as a **Fullstack Software Developer**, which first turned into a part-time, then a full-time job after my graduation. At Gerhardt Informatics, I was able to actively deepen my soft and hard skills, while I contributed to multiple successful projects.

Currently I work as a Software Engineer at SAP.
